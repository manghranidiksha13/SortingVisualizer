# Sorting Visualizer

A web-based application designed to visualize how various sorting algorithms function. This tool provides a graphical representation of the sorting process, making it easier to understand the logic and efficiency of algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

## 🚀 Features

* **Multiple Algorithms**: Visualizes 5 fundamental sorting algorithms.
* **Customizable Controls**:
    * **Array Size**: Adjust the number of elements to sort (ranging from 5 to 100).
    * **Speed**: Control the visualization speed (from 1.00x to 20.00x).
* **Random Generation**: Instantly generate new random arrays to test.
* **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded animations to indicate comparisons, swaps, and final sorted states.
* **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.

## 🛠 Algorithms Included

1.  **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2.  **Selection Sort**: Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.
3.  **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
4.  **Merge Sort**: An efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, meaning that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output.
5.  **Quick Sort**: An efficient, in-place, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm.

## 💻 Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **JavaScript**

## 🎨 Visual Color Guide

* **Pink**: Default unsorted state.
* **Yellow**: Elements currently being compared or swapped.
* **Dark Pink**: The current minimum value found (specific to Selection Sort).
* **Green**: Elements that are in their final sorted position.
